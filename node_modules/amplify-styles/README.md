# Amplify Pattern Library

The Amplify Pattern Library is a modular design system for rapid web page development. It contains different materials that can be assembled into more complex page layouts.
This project was based on [fabricator](https://github.com/fbrctr/fbrctr.github.io) and those docs contain [some helpful tips on working with this type of toolkit](http://fbrctr.github.io/getting-started/working-with-fabricator.html).

## Getting Started

### Install
CFER-Toolkit requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org). Make sure your have `v0.10` or higher installed before proceeding.

**Dependencies:**
- Ruby
- SCSS lint Ruby gem (to install run `gem install scss_lint`)

**Install the project:**

```
$ git clone git@github.com:amplifylitco/cfer-toolkit.git
$ npm run build
```

### Run (locally)

**Start the local development environment:**
```
$ npm start
```

This will run the build process, including all Gulp tasks.  It will open the site on ```localhost:3000``` in your default browser.

All updates will immediately post to the UI Toolkit.

### Development Environment Features

- Live preview sever (using [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/))
- CSS Autoprefixing
- Sass compilation
- Webkit dependency injection
- Image optimization

## Build

**Build Fabricator Demo page:**

```
$ npm run build
```

This builds both a static documentation site and optimized CSS and JS toolkit files.

The build artifacts output to the `dist` directory. It can be pushed to [cfer-toolkit-demo](https://github.com/amplifylitco/cfer-toolkit-demo) repository and all changes appear at [CFER Demo page](https://amplifylitco.github.io/cfer-toolkit-demo/).

## Updating

Update files in the `src` directory:

- `assets` - static assets (stylesheets, javascript, images) for both Fabricator generated demo page and your CFER Toolkit.

- `data` - yml or json files that can be fed into Demo materials and views.

- `docs` - markdown files with toolkit-wide documentation that is displayed on demo page.

- `materials` - individual pieces of UI with Toolkit elements. Each file within is registered as a Handlebars partial for rapid prototyping.

- `views` - pages of the style guide + documentation site that Fabricator generates. Also where any prototyping pages are placed.
